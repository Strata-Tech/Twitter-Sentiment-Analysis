# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

# Background
Twitter is a platform where people express their feelings towards the current context. As humans, we can guess the sentiment of a sentence whether it is positive or negative. In this project I have used “Tweepy,” which is an easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API. A Twitter developer account and sample codes to do this analysis

Sentiment of tweets are analyzed as positive, negative and neutral. Tweepy is used to collect tweets which requires twitter development account. Tweets are cleaned as they contain RT,url @username etc. Also stopwords, punctuation are removed as part of data cleaning.
